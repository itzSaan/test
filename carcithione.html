                <h5>For Oncology Promotion.</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Recent studies have highlighted the importance of GSH in key signal transduction reactions as a controller of cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, ferroptosis and immune function. Molecular changes in the GSH antioxidant system and disturbances in GSH homeostasis have been implicated in tumor initiation, progression, and treatment response. Hence, GSH has both protective and pathogenic roles. Although in healthy cells it is crucial for the removal and detoxification of carcinogens, elevated GSH levels in tumor cells are associated with tumor progression and increased resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Recently, several novel therapies have been developed to target the GSH antioxidant system in tumors as a means for increased response and decreased drug resistance.</li>
                  <li>In many cancers associated with mutations in genes encoding electron transport chain proteins there is increased ROS production that is associated with resistance to apoptosis. For instance, impaired Complex I function associated with ND6 mutations leads to high levels of ROS generation and a highly metastatic phenotype that can be prevented by ROS scavengers</li>
                  <li>The literature reviewed in our work indicates that GSH and GSH-related moieties play a significant role in tumor initiation, progression, and drug resistance. Although it has been known for some time that GSH is important in these processes, the distinct role it plays at each step is still being elucidated. </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>For Ortho Promotion.</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Glutathione as a mediator of cartilage oxidative stress resistance and resilience during aging and osteoarthritis</li>
                <li>Several recent studies have reviewed the role of oxidative stress and altered redox signaling in OA pathophysiology, which includes greater levels of oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA in cartilage and other joint tissues11,12,19. This pro-oxidant environment is traditionally attributed to insufficient oxidative stress resistance due to an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the ability of the body to detoxify their harmful effects through neutralization by antioxidants</li>
                <li>Emerging evidence shows that insufficient oxidative stress resistance can also apply to non-radical mechanisms since there are major thiol systems active under stable nonequilibrium conditions20. These non-radical mechanisms involve 2-electron oxidants (e.g. H2O2) that disrupt thiol redox circuits, leading to pro-inflammatory and aberrant cell signaling.</li>
                <li>Oxidative stress is considered a fundamental component of the age-related pathological changes in cartilage11. We recently reported that cartilage undergoes increased glutathione oxidation in aging F344-BN F1 hybrid rats28. These data were consistent with a prior study by Del Carlo and Loeser  who showed that glutathione oxidation increased with a age in chondrocytes isolated from young and old human donors that did not have a history of joint disease</li>
                <li>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major painful chronic joint disease affecting various anatomical sites including the hip, knee and hand, being responsible for loss of function and disability in adults</li>
                <li>The recent demonstration of the importance of oxidative stress in osteoarthritis places the use of intra-articular antioxidants, namely glutathione and its precursor, as an important interventional strategy for both joint preparation for biologic therapies as well as a powerful ally in viscosupplementation. Multiple studies have presented the numerous beneficial effects and safety of the administration of glutathione for the management of debilitating musculoskeletal disorders, especially OA</li>
